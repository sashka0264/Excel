### Get Started

```
'npm i'
'npm run start' for developer version or 'npm run build' for production version and open index.html in ./dist
```

### Memo (for me)

```
git checkout -b 'webpack'
doing work in webpack branch
do pull request (and merge in github)
git checkout master
git pull origin master
end
```
